# Introduction 
Image Filtering Enhancement is one of the most important processes in Digital Image processing, It is used to 
remove noise, sharpen the contrast, edge detection, and contours highlight, [24] by applying a specific 
algorithm to the image, one of the most used domain to regard the image is Spatial domain techniques that it
is a spatial distribution operate directly on the pixels of the image and it categories into Gray-level 
transformation and Spatial Filtering, [25] we will focus on the spatial filtering which categorized to Linear 
Spatial filtering (Mean filter) which is widely used in digital image processing for blurring hide the small gaps 
in lines and curves and Non-linear spatial filtering (median filter) where it‚Äôs a very popular use for noise 
reduction such as impulse noise and salt and pepper noise. This paper aims to explain how the mean and 
median filters work and design discrete implementation of the mean and median filters on MATLAB from 
scratch with basic syntax and make the code operate with and respectively without padding and with padding 
by zero and padding by replication the user will be asked at the start of the program about padding.

## Background section

As mentioned in the introduction, the spatial domine techniques operate directly on the pixels of an image, 
the spatial domain process discussed in references [26] [27] where the expression denoted by a mathematical 
equation

                                           ùëî(ùë•, ùë¶) = ùëá [ùëì(ùë•, ùë¶)]
Where f (x, y) is the input image and g (x, y) is the processed image, and T is an operator of f, defined over a 
specified Neighborhood. So that the image can be modified by applying a particular function to each pixel
value. The idea is to define a spatial neighborhood of the image is use a rectangle ‚Äúmask\kernel‚Äù region 
usually with sides of odd length 3x3 or 5x5 moved from pixel to pixel over the given image after that a new 
image will be created whose pixels have grey values calculated from the grey values under the mask as 
illustrated in figure 1.
                                            <img width="389" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40359381/178124205-b04ca493-08f6-4f0e-9b34-a1ac2bff59aa.png">

The combination of mask and function is called Filter, there are two principal terms to identify operation neighborhood 
processing and spatial filtering. Spatial filtering is more popular, if the computations performed on pixels of 
neighborhoods are linear, the operation is called linear spatial filtering [28] which means if they use a linear function 
in the mask operator the filter is called linear filter, otherwise called a nonlinear spatial filter.

The following equations are examples of Linear and Non-linear Filters:

<img width="402" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40359381/178124268-22d37f66-b3c7-46a8-a174-d64c926322e8.png">

### A Linear Filters:

operation consists of multiplying each pixel in the mask by corresponding element in the 
neighbourhood, and adding up all these products, As showing in ref [29] the strategy of linear spatial filtering is shown 
in figure 31, the process consists simply of moving the centre of the filter mask from point to point in an image f, 


<img width="467" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40359381/178124298-453d98cd-cdf1-43aa-b884-4067d8bb3c25.png">

The following equation shows the mathematical formula if linear filter: [30]
<img width="236" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40359381/178124318-100e085e-575a-4031-8366-7877532090ae.png">

The form an be normalised be multiplying it with a factor 1 / ùëö*ùë• 

<img width="250" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40359381/178124340-f53baa04-8d93-4d84-ae5c-fa5b4db3ac4e.png">

### Averaging Filter:

One of the most popular Smoothing spatial linear filters is Averaging\mean filter, it is widely used to remove small 
gabs in lines or curves‚Äù irrelevant details‚Äù in the image, the output of it is smoothed image with reduced in sharp with 
blur edges. 

How it is Work? 

* The Averaging Filter take the average of the pixels contained in the neighbourhood of the filter mask. 

<img width="188" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40359381/178124370-ea094140-7561-4a41-ad34-c1ccf81960cd.png">

*  The process of work could be illustrated in the following Figure 32 shows the mask, the main idea is replacing 
the value of every pixel in an image by the averaging of the gray level in the neighbourhood defined in the filter 
mask.  

<img width="301" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40359381/178124380-41eee6c5-e743-4c03-916f-8e5374b97c15.png">

*  The mask dimension M x N has a direct effect on the processed image when the mask dimension increases the 
blur in image increase that shown in following images:

<img width="362" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40359381/178124392-db8b2554-a0d4-4d0e-8212-77e4ddce87ee.png">

*  As shown in figure 33 the blurring which increased whenever the mask size increases and removing small 
objects with the background when the mask size increase, also we notice the black border because of padding 
the borders of the original image and the quality of image ins reduced. 

## The Non-linear Spatial filters 

Neighborhood operations are also used in nonlinear spatial filtering and the strategy of defining a Mask and sliding it 
over every pixel in image [31], However, we discussed in last section the linear filters based on linear operation such as 
sum of product, On the other hand, the nonlinear spatial filters is based on nonlinear operations such as taking the 
maximum element in the mask in Max Filters or taking the maximum element in the mask in Min Filters or taking a 
medium element in median filters, some books [32]called it an order-statistics filters because the response of it based 
on ordering (ranking) the pixels in the neighbourhood and then replacing the value of the centre pixels with the value 
determined by ranking result. Example of nonlinear filters: Max, Min, and Median filters. 

This paper we will focus on Median filter: which widely used in removing impulse noise (Salt and pepper noise), the 
median filter strategy [33] is sliding the mask over the image pixel by pixel replacing each value with the 
median(medium) value of neighbouring pixels. The median is calculated by sorting all the pixels values from the mask 
into numerical order and replacing the pixel being considered with the middle (Median) pixels value the figure 34 
illustrate the working technique of median filter.

<img width="298" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40359381/178124414-860509e6-77b5-4413-ba66-523054b8c1c7.png">

The effect of Median filter shows in figure 35.

<img width="484" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40359381/178124421-26520d72-630c-4b3a-919d-adb3ff74e666.png">

The original image containing a significant amount slat & pepper noise (impulse noise), the effect of process this image 
by median filter illustrates in figure 35 which all noise removed while preserving edges. 

## The following diagram show the distribution of Spatial filters:

 <img width="536" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40359381/178124449-804dd59e-23af-48d0-94cd-b99cf94b635b.png">
 
### The concept of Correlation and convolution:  

When doing lineal spatial filtering [29], two crucial principles must be highlighted: the first is correlation, and the second 
is convolution. Figure 31 depicts the correlation process of passing the mask w via picture array f. The convolution 
method is the same, except that w is rotated by 180 degrees before being passed by f. the following figure 38 show the 
different between correlation and convolution. 

<img width="385" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40359381/178124468-b9e7c919-729c-43d4-85dc-80508b4f877c.png">

## Edge effect and Padding in Spatial Filtering:  

The output image sometimes not the same as input image that appeared in figure 33 when we applied a average filter 
with big size mask the output image has a black borders, and to solve this problem we should apply Padding on processed 
image. As mentioned in discussion [34]The padding is the process of adding additional pixels in input image to keep 
the processed image size the same as input image. There are two types of padding the first one is ‚Äúzero padding‚Äù which 
it is adding extra row & column of zeros on each side of the image, and it leads to a dark border effect, where the second

<img width="544" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40359381/178124492-8b0050ed-05b6-48b1-b5fb-a34d86ad7965.png">

one is Replication padding which replicate the pixels value in additional row and column on each side of the image, the 
figure 39 shows the different types of padding. 

## The aims and objectives of the paper:

The main aim of the paper is to design a discrete implementation of Mean and respectively median filters with mask 
3x3 on MATLAB from scratch with basic syntax, and the code will be operated without padding and with zero padding 
and padding with replication.

* This will be made by designing a mean algorithm which will take a mask 3x3 sum all element of it and divided 
by 9 after that replacing the value in output image.
* Also, designing a Median Algorithm by making a sorting algorithm that collect all element in the mask and 
store them in array after that it will take the medium element in the array and replace it in output image.
* The program will operate in three different cases the first one applying the two algorithms mentioned on image 
without padding which will reduce the dimension of it, the second applying the same algorithms on image 
(matrix) with padded by zeros the output image will be the same size, the third one will be applying the 
algorithms in image(matrix) padded by replicate. 
* The user will be asked at the first of program about choosing the padding option o= without padding, 1=padding 
by zeros, 2=padding by replicate. 

## Design the Algorithm 
The program will be able to filter the image(matrix) by mean and median filters respectively without padding and 
padding by zeros and padding by replicate. This section will discuss the mean and median designed algorithm and 
strategy of solving the problem. The Following figure 40 show the Program Flowchart and Plan.

<img width="589" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40359381/178124555-830ecf5b-3f6e-470a-aa9d-c4e13ff31fc8.png">

## The Plan description and Strategy 

As shown in Figure 40 the program flowchart consists of three parts are common in mean algorithm and median 
algorithm and different in padding strategies, the following section will discuss the process of implementing Mean and 
median algorithms. 
Before we started to develop the algorithms for those filters, I took a long time in searching on internet and I found 
many people and websites discussed this thing here some of them [35], [36], [37], [38], [39]. 

### Mean Filter Strategy:  

*  The main idea of Mean Filter is to make a mask for example (3x3) and slide this mask in every pixel in image 
and take the sum of all elements and divided them all by 9 and put the value in output image (matrix). the figure 
41 shows the process of mean filter the right matrix is matrix without padding the black line is the matrix and 
the 3x3 cube line is the MASK 3x3 the mask will start from row 2 and col 2 and it will move in every pixel in 
the image sum all elements inside it and divided them by 9 and put the output in output matrix as shown in 
figure 41

<img width="536" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40359381/178124610-0ffc1a72-b0f6-4401-b59f-edef02b479a1.png">

*  When applying mean or median filter on unpadded image such as figure 41 the output image(matrix) size 
decreased that‚Äôs make a border looking sharping and black this problem mentioned in background section, so 
to avoid this we pad the image with zeros or replicate to keep the dimension as it is. The following figure 42 
illustrates the process of applying mean filter on image(matrix) padding by zeros or replicate. 

<img width="533" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40359381/178124633-e32d83b4-a6fb-449a-b4b2-8acd840b64e0.png">


To implementing MATLAB code that will make the mean filter we have two challenge the first one to make the mask 
slide on image(matrix) pixels and the second is to sum all elements inside the mask and replace it in output 
image(matrix).

For the first challenge: we will get the size of image(matrix) by function called size [40] and store the size of matrix 
in variables row and col (row X col) after that, we will use nested loop [41] the first one (i) will be to move the mask 
from row 2 till the row-1 and the second (j) to move the mask from column 2 to the col-1 this will scan the image
(matrix) in every pixel starting from position (2,2) till the end depending on matrix size. 

The second challenge: to sum the elements and divided them by 9 in the mask the figure 43 illustrates the mask element 
notation.
<img width="191" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40359381/178124649-a077b600-5058-49ad-9009-cee5087d9e96.png">

The Algorithm will divide every element by 9 and sum them all and store the output pixel average mask in matrix new 
called imnew(i,j) and the type of it is double as shown in figure 44. 

<img width="526" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40359381/178124664-f1069213-eac5-41ae-a1c6-5defde38e882.png">

The process will repeat until the row-1 and col-1 reach zeros and loop will stop. 

In case of padding by zeros and padding be replicate, at the first we will define a new matrix padded by function called 
arraypad [42] and will take the size of it and substitute in the mean algorithm after that rearrange the matrix and display 
it in command window. 

## The Median filter Strategy 

*  The main idea of median filter is to arrange the elements of the mask 3x3 in array and take the medium pixel in 
that array and substitute by it in the output image(matrix) as shown in figure 45 

<img width="536" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40359381/178124690-bc22c5b2-edde-48e1-8b48-94c51a5d64fc.png">

*  As mean filter when applying median filter on unpadded image the size of image decrease because of the mask 
should cover 3x3 region that cause problem of sharping edges of the output image, that problem covered in 
background section, to avoid this problem we pad the input image borders by zeros or replicate and the output 
image will give us the same dimension of input image. That‚Äôs illustrated in figure 46. 

<img width="467" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40359381/178124700-4389d855-5f41-4b84-afd9-496aadd8053a.png">

The moving of Mask strategy will be the same as discussed in mean filter section, we will make use of size function and 
nested loop strategy to scan the input image (matrix) pixel by pixel from row 2 and col 2 to the end and apply median 
algorithm on it and substitute the output value in output image (matrix) as shown in figures 45,46. 

Before, we go inside the loop the empty array will be made called Med= [] and output matrix will be defined and well,
Inside the loop the sorting Algorithm will store all elements in the mask inside the empty array as shown in figure 47. 

<img width="518" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40359381/178124727-5f92811f-9afc-424a-b479-a00f92bb44ce.png">

After adding all elements inside the empty array, we will choose the medium element in the array by median [43]
function and put the output value inside the output matrix. This process will be repeated on overall pixels on the input 
image(matrix).

## Description of the Code

## Results Section 

In this section the code will be tested by comparing the result of it by a ready-made function on MATLAB:
